Ultimate is the fifth game in its franchise. It is also the first game in its series to be released for Nintendo Switch. The series is a crossover of characters from various video game franchises, such as The Legend of Zelda, Pokemon, Sonic the Hedgehog, Super Mario, Metroid, and Mega Man, among many others. Their famous protagonists fight each other on an arena. In accordance with its name, the game is the ''ultimate'' installment of the series, in that it offers the players all the characters ever featured in Super Smash Bros. The game also introduces five new characters, most famously, Castlevania''s Simon Belmont. Unlike most fighting games, Super Smash Bros. series is built around knocking opponents out of the arena rather than lowering their health bars. However, the damage meter increases the character''s chances to be knocked out. Each fighter has a limited number of lives and loses one when he or she is knocked out. The player is eliminated when he or she loses all lives. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate includes several competitive multiplayer modes. Besides the traditional versus mode, there are several new modes not featured in the previous games. These include Tournament (the playoff mode for 32 players), Smash Squad (team multiplayer), Smashdown (a mode in which the defeated characters are eliminated).') ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Additionally, Strike Force missions, available in 2025, feature permanent death - if the character is killed, you can''t return to the checkpoint, and have to continue the game without them.

There''s an extensive backstory that explains the protagonist''s motivation in gathering Starites. We learn that Max and his sister Lily played pranks on people using their magic notebook until it got them into trouble. One day they unknowingly played a trick against an old wizard. He grew angry and magically turned Lily into stone. Max can only save his sister by gathering enough Starites. Unlike previous parts, this game is set in an open, albeit cartoonish, world, that gradually opens to you as you gather more Starites.

Boost Mode also makes cooperative speed runs possible for the first time. Use the GamePad to interact with and manipulate enemies and objects in real time, and discover new ways to find the fastest route through each stage. In addition to the main Story Mode, in which players must rescue Princess Peach, New Super Mario Bros. U features three more exciting game modes, including: ◦ Boost Rush: Using Boost Mode, two to five players work together to clear many different courses in the fastest time possible. The scene auto scrolls, forcing you to move ahead through the course. As you collect more coins, the scene scrolls faster. Once you''ve completed your run, you can watch a replay of other players'' Boost Rush to help strategize for your next attempt. ◦ Challenge Mode: Numerous single-player and multiplayer challenges incorporate a series of familiar Super Mario gameplay concepts in a fun, competitive way. These challenges offer high replay value as players try to achieve the best score and unlock new challenges. Boost Mode Challenges help players practice the teamwork necessary for effective Boost Mode gameplay. After finishing, players can watch a replay of their Challenge to strategize for next time. Play on the big screen or the small screen. Switch single-player gameplay from the TV to the GamePad at any time to continue playing even when others are using the TV.

Up to five players can participate in dynamic multiplayer modes in select attractions.* The experiences change depending on whether players are using the GamePad, a Wii Remote controller or just watching others play on the TV screen.
Nintendo Land features fun-filled theme park attractions based on Nintendo''s greatest game worlds, including Mario Chase, The Legend of Zelda: Battle Quest, Pikmin Adventure and more. There are 12 attractions in all.
Different activities take advantage of the second screen of the new Wii U GamePad controller in different ways. For example, simply slide a finger across the touch screen to seamlessly fire ninja stars in the action-based Takamaru''s Ninja Castle. In Donkey Kong''s Crash Course, tilt the GamePad left and right to safely navigate an elaborate obstacle course.
Dynamic multiplayer that offers different experiences in the same game. Even in the same attraction, the player using the GamePad will have a completely different experience than players using the TV: In Luigi''s Ghost Mansion, the player using the GamePad is able to control a ghost invisible to players using the TV. In Metroid Blast, the player with the GamePad controls an aerial gunship versus the ground-based players using the TV.
The attractions are easy to pick up and play, but also contains deeper levels of play that are sure to challenge even the most experienced gamers. Metroid Blast, for example, contains a deep mission mode as well as a competitive surface-air combat mode.
Attractions are grouped into three types: ○ Team Attractions like Metroid Blast and The Legend of Zelda: Battle Quest that offer depth and challenge for 1 to 5 players. ○ Competitive Attractions like Mario Chase and Animal Crossing: Sweet Day where 2 to 5 players compete against each other. ○ Solo Attractions like Takamaru''s Ninja Castle, Donkey Kong''s Crash Course and Balloon Trip Breeze, that offer simple but fun and engaging play for one player.
Each attraction has multiple fun challenges designed to keep visitors coming back for more. Players will receive stamps upon completing special challenges.

His vengeance against the Gods of Olympus years behind him, Kratos now lives as a man in the realm of Norse Gods and monsters. It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive… And teach his son to do the same. This startling reimagining of God of War deconstructs the core elements that defined the series—satisfying combat; breathtaking scale; and a powerful narrative—and fuses them anew.

As mentor and protector to Atreus, a son determined to earn his respect, he is forced to deal with and control the rage that has long defined him while out in a very dangerous world with his son. From the marble and columns of ornate Olympus to the gritty forests, mountains, and caves of Pre-Viking Norse lore, this is a distinctly new realm with its own pantheon of creatures, monsters, and gods. With an added emphasis on discovery and exploration, the world will draw players in to explore every inch of God of War''s breathtakingly threatening landscape—by far the largest in the franchise. With an over the shoulder free camera that brings the player closer to the action than ever before, fights in God of War mirror the pantheon of Norse creatures Kratos will face: grand, gritty, and grueling.

The story of the game follows series protagonists Banjo and Kazooie as they attempt to stop the plans of antagonist Gruntilda and her two sisters from vapourising the inhabitants of the game''s world. Development of the game started in June 1998, directly after the release of its predecessor. Several new features were cut from the game due to time constraints and limitations of the Nintendo 64 hardware. Banjo-Tooie features levels that are significantly larger than those of its predecessor and requires the player to complete various challenges such as solving puzzles, collecting items, and defeating bosses. It also includes a multiplayer mode where up to four players can compete in several minigames. Upon release, the game sold more than three million copies and received critical acclaim from video game critics. The game is also included in the Rare Replay video game compilation, released for the Xbox One in 2015.') ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

It was released for the Nintendo 64 video game console in August 1997. The game features a single-player campaign in which players assume the role of British Secret Intelligence Service agent James Bond as he fights to prevent a criminal syndicate from using a satellite weapon against London to cause a global financial meltdown. The game includes a split-screen multiplayer mode in which two, three, or four players can compete in different types of deathmatch games. GoldenEye 007 was developed over a period of two and a half years by an inexperienced team led by Martin Hollis, who had previously worked on the coin-op version of Killer Instinct. It was partially conceived as an on-rails shooter inspired by Sega''s Virtua Cop, before being redesigned as a free-roaming shooter. The game was highly acclaimed by the gaming media and sold over eight million copies worldwide, making it the third-best-selling Nintendo 64 game. It received the BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Games Award and four awards from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences. Retrospectively, GoldenEye 007 is considered an important game in the history of first-person shooters for demonstrating the viability of game consoles as platforms for the genre, and for signalling a transition from the then-standard Doom-like approach to a more realistic style. It pioneered features such as atmospheric single-player missions, stealth elements, and a console multiplayer deathmatch mode. The game is frequently cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. A spiritual successor, Perfect Dark, was released in 2000, while a reimagining of the game, also titled GoldenEye 007, was released in 2010.') ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Throughout the story, the player will observe as the protagonist rises the ranks, sometimes making decisions of questionable nobility or profit. Our goal as a player is to ensure that Vercetti becomes the boss of all of Vice City’s mafia, and various story characters will help us or prevent us from achieving this goal. The worlds of Grand Theft Auto series have long been worked upon and have been done in much detail, and Vice City is no different. The people on the sidewalks, the stylish cars and neon light clubs, the sky-high buildings and lively piers and beaches, everything will bring nostalgic feelings to those of players, whose eyes have seen the glory of this time.

Seven greatest mages sealed the monsters underground and left one entrance through a hole in the Ebott mountain. A lot of time passed since the war, but a human child accidentally falls down the mountain. Its goal is to get back out. Undertale uses pixelated graphics and traditional mechanics of RPGs such as earning experience points, having an open world, and so on. As the game goes on, the player has to solve several puzzles and interact with NPCs. The battles in the game are represented using the bullet hell mini-games with the player having an option to choose where they want to spare their opponent or hit the enemy back. Monsters behavior depends on the player''s actions: if one decides to use a peaceful approach it will be easier to dodge the enemies attacks and vice versa. The game features a branching story and several endings. The ending the player gets depends on whether they spared or killed the monsters they encountered throughout the game.')

The game was developed by the same team who are responsible for the Street Fighter III series. It was originally released in the arcade in 1998 on the CPS-3 arcade system; this version was known outside Japan as JoJo''s Venture. An updated version of the game was released in 1999 as JoJo''s Bizarre Adventure: Heritage for the Future (ジョジョの奇妙な冒険 未来への遺産, JoJo no Kimyō na Bōken Mirai e no Isan), becoming the sixth and last game released for the CPS-3 board. Console ports for the PlayStation and Dreamcast were also released that year. A high-definition version of the game was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in August 2012. The game combines Capcom''s trademark anime-inspired graphics, as seen in the Darkstalkers series, with the colorful characters and events of Hirohiko Araki''s creation, resulting in a highly stylized and detailed visual style. It also features many of the gameplay mechanics seen on previous Capcom fighting games, such as the use of power gauges for super moves, as well as a brand new Stand Mode, consisting of the series'' signature guardian spirits that accompanies almost every character and can be summoned or dismissed at will by the player, resulting in variations in the character''s move list and abilities. Original author Hirohiko Araki served as a consultant for the game and created exclusive pieces of artwork for its promotion and packaging; most notably, he developed from scratch a new character design for Midler, since Capcom was interested in using her in the game and she had been only shown from the waist-down in the original manga.')

Like its predecessor, Pikmin 2 focuses on exploring the surface of an unknown planet from a microscopic perspective, where the player directs and delegates tasks to a horde of tiny plant-like creatures called Pikmin. The Pikmin can be directed to destroy obstacles, defeat enemies and retrieve objects. It introduces many gameplay mechanics not seen in Pikmin, including the ability to control two different leaders of the Pikmin at once and the addition of new Pikmin types. The game received critical acclaim, gaining aggregate scores of 89.60% and 90 on GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively. Many critics praised the additions to the Pikmin gameplay, such as the removal of the 30-day time limit imposed in the original game.

The protagonist, a mercenary named Ike, discovers Princess Elincia, the last heir to the throne of Crimea, and begins a journey to restore her to the throne.
